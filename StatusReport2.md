### Data Description BLUF ###

After analyzing network captures and memory dumps, our team determined that multiple machines either don't exist at all or are on different IP addresses according to the networking charts provided by IT. This may seem like a small matter, but if IT doesn't keep regular track of their network, attackers could infiltrate and add/remove machines at will without anybody else noticing. All IP addresses are on the 192.168.100 subnet. Some machines show short streams of HTTP/HTTPS data. This is enough to transfer data in clear text.

Disk analysis shows that employees on the TaxOffice_4 machine are keeping SSNs in cleartext under the Documents folder for MillyBond and MikeGold. This is a major security concern, because if the network is breached, attackers can easily exfiltrate them and cause massive damages to the Mayor's employees. We found a large numbers of cat pictures on ShareDrive paired with their "cleartext" partner. This indicates some type of ransomware attack.

Further memory analysis shows possible malicious processes running on multiple systems.

When doing log analysis, we noticed there were new types of events occurring on 3/3 that did not occur any other days. There is also an hour and a half of log adata missing on 3/2. We noticed the same small set of users sending a majority of the emails. **which Ones?**


### Network Data ###
- Is your network data contiguous? If not, what does your network data cover? **Yes, the network devices are all found on the 192.168.100.0 subnet. However, the information found within the disk images doesn't seem to line up with the information found in the network captures. See table for more details.**

- Does your network data cover all systems? If not, identify where in the network that you think the capture covers and what it doesn't cover. **See below diagrams under IT_2 and explanation**

These network diagrams show how the company has grown over the years according to IT_2 user RoyTremmeman. The interesting part is the most recent diagram, 12-10-19, was deleted for an unknown reason.

Based on analysis across Disks, Memory, Network, etc., the network data seems to cover all systems, although the diagrams aren't completely accurate as shown in the first table.

- Do the services that are hosted on the systems make sense for the services that should be offered from those systems. **This is where the network captures differ from the provided network diagrams. See below.**
  - **In the diagrams above, the Domain Controller (DC) is said to be 192.168.100.1, but during analysis we found that to be 192.168.100.10. In addition to the memory dump, port analysis shows 192.168.100.10 had ports 445 and 139 (SMB), 143 (IMAP), 88 (Kerberos), and 389 (LDAP) sourcing from it much more than any other port. These ports are indicative of a Windows Domain Controller running File Sharing on SMB, Mail on IMAP, and Active Directory on Kerberos and LDAP.**
  - **One peculiar machine was 192.168.100.12 (claimed to be the Tax Office host) which had 220 packets sourcing from TCP 80 (HTTP). This isn't very many packets in the long run, but it's worth noting as it's easy to transmit cleartext data over this insecure protocol**
  - **Another instance of similar proportion happened on 192.168.100.19 (an unknown host) but over TCP 443 (HTTPS). This isn't as concerning unless an attacker were to get system-level access, in which case they could transmit malicious encrypted data across the network without being discovered.**

### Forensic Image Analysis ###
- What are those systems used for? **See table**
- What user accounts exist on each system? **See table**
- What do you know about the activities or actions of the user accounts prior to the incident?
- Are there any issues with the accounts that you have found? Are they all authorized? Do you know anything about their passwords? **Local admin hash dumped from memory**
- What software is installed on each system? Was there anything installed recently?
- Identify and explore common vectors of attack - phishing, malicious web pages, malicious software installations, etc.

### Memory Forensics ###
- Is each of the programs running on the system a normal process?
  - **Most processes running on the systems appear to be normal, with some exceptions (see below)**
- Are any of the processes running abnormal?
  - **IT_2, Mayor1_3, Mayor1_4, Mayor2_3, Mayor2_4 all have MRCv120.exe process running on them. It is also seen when performing the Disk Analysis. It is unclear at this point what its function is.**
  - **All Systems had a higher than expected count of svchost.exe processes running**
  - **WinServer_3, WinServer_1, Mayor2_4 Systems all have some unexpected output when running psxview**
    - **Multiple processes shown have no name or unexpected names - could potentially be malware trying to hide itself**
- How much memory does each process take up? Is that a normal amount?
- What do you know about the code that is running?
- Consider spinning up similar systems to do a process-by-process comparison

### Log Files ###
- For each type of log entry - what systems contribute log entries?
  - **DEBUG**
  - **TCP/IP**
  - **IMAPD**
  - **SMTPD**
  - **APPLICATION**
- Are there any time gaps in your log files?
  - **There is a time gap on 2020-03-02 between 2020-03-02 13:23:33.345 and 16:32:24.835.**
  - **There is another time gap on 2020-03-02 from 17:53:01.094 to 00:00:00.00.**
  - **On 2020-03-03, logs are only captured between 12:10:01.493 and 13:29:34.351.**
- Are there any unusual log entries? If so, what makes them unusual?
  - **There are "Server started" APPLICATION logs on 3/3 midday but not on any of the other days. I would think if this did occur, it would be early morning**
  - **There were DNS query failure TCPIP logs on 3/3 but not any of the other days.**
  - **The same few email users are sending all of the emails.**


### IOCs ###
- Identify any preliminary IOCs that you have found.  Provide some statement of confidence of your analysis of those IOCs.
  - **Large numbers of cat pictures found on ShareDrive paired with their "cleartext" partner. This indicates some type of ransomware attack.**

### Questions and Concerns ###
- Identify any questions you have for the client
- Identify any concerns or issues that your team has
